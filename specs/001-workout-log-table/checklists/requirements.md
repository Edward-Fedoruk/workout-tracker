- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain

- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items passed. Specification is complete and all critical ambiguities clarified (4 questions resolved in Session 2026-05-18). Ready for planning phase.

### Clarifications Applied

- Table layout: Separate columns per set (Set1_weight, Set1_reps, ..., Set5_weight, Set5_reps)
- Validation: Minimum 1 set required; future dates rejected
- Default sort: Most recent workout first (descending date order)
